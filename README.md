# Game Theory App

The past year I've learned a lot about artificial intelligence, heuristic algorithms, crafting & optimization of algorithms. For this reason I've decided to test my skills and code a basic Tic-tac-toe solver...

The actual logic of the game-theory algorithms is written in [GO](https://go.dev) and on top of that I've added a user interface written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and served via [Lorca](https://github.com/zserge/lorca) from [GO](https://go.dev).

Tic-tac-toe has a very limited space complexity (there are 3^9 = 19683 possible field layouts) which was easily handled by a basic [Minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax), nevertheless I've optimized it with [Alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphaâ€“beta_pruning) and state [Memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) with a simple [Dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) approach.
